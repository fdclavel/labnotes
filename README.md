# Lab Notes
## *Notes from Winter 2019 R lab sessions at UCSD*

This repository contains a limited set of lab notes from a course on the use of R for a variety of common statistical procedures. Most examples are pretty heavy with examples from biology and oceanography in particular (this course was taught at Scripps Institute of Oceanography at UC San Diego, so bear with it if that's not your area - it isn't mine either).

Primarily included for my own benefit and record-keeping. some of the notes are just that - notes. They may be incomplete or slightly inaccurate since I was writing and running most of it during lab lectures, using class guides. If you're cool with that caveat, feel free to browse for a few random handy pointers and code snippets.
